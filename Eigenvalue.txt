===== Definiton: =====
The scalar multiple of which eigenvectors are scaled by.

===== Finding the eigenvalues of a matrix: =====
We do this by using what is called the [[Eigenvalue Equation|eigenvalue equations]]:

Given some matrix A, we take the determinate of A and subtract lambda multiplied by the identity matrix and set the result equal to 0.
