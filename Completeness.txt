====== Completeness ======
Created Saturday 14 March 2020

===== Definition: =====
Completeness in the context of [[Vector|vectors]] means we can use linear combinations of the [[Eigenvector|eigenvectors]] of a [[Basis|basis]] to describe any [[Vector|vector]] that exists in that space.

In the context of quantum mechanics, this means we can use linear combinations of the [[Basis|basis]] [[Ket|kets]] to describe any [[Quantum States|quantum state]] for that [[Basis|basis]]'s [[Hilbert Space]].

===== Usefulness: =====
See [[Completeness Relation]].
