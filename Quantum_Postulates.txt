====== Quantum Postulates ======
Created Saturday 14 March 2020

===== Postulate 1: =====
The state of a [[Quantum Mechanical System|quantum mechanical system]], including all the information you can know about it, is represented mathematically by a [[Normalization|normalized]] [[Ket|ket]].

===== Postulate 2: =====
A physical [[Observables|observable]] is represented mathematically by an [[Operator|operator]] //A// that acts on [[Ket|kets]].

===== Postulate 3: =====
The only possible result of a measurement of an [[Observables|observable]] is one of the [[Eigenvalue|eigenvalues]] //a//_{n }of the corresponding [[Operator|operator]] //A//.

===== Postulate 4: =====
The probability of obtaining the [[Eigenvalue|eigenvalue]] //a//_{n} in a measurement of the [[Observables|observable]] //A //on the [[Quantum Mechanical System|system]] in a [[Quantum States|state]] is:

{{..\postulate_4.png}}

where  //a//_{n} is the [[Normalization|normalized]] [[Eigenvector|eigenvector]] of A corresponding to the [[Eigenvalue|eigenvalue]]  //a//_{n}.

===== Postulate 5: =====
After a measurement of A that yields the result  //a//_{n}, the [[Quantum Mechanical System|quantum system]] is in a new [[Quantum States|state]] that is the [[Normalization|normalized]] [[Projection|projection]] of the original [[Quantum Mechanical System|system]] [[Ket|ket]] onto the [[Ket|ket]] (or [[Ket|kets]]) corresponding to the result of the measurement:

===== Postulate 6: =====
The time evolution of a [[Quantum Mechanical System|quantum system]] is determined by the [[Hamiltonian]] or total energy [[Operator|operator]] //H(t) //through the [[Schrodinger Equation|Schrodinger equation]].
