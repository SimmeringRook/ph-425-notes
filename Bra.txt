====== Bra ======
Created Saturday 14 March 2020

A bra is the [[Hermitian Adjoint|Hermitian adjoint]] of a [[Ket|ket]]. We can also display this information with [[Matrix|matrices]], in which case a bra represents a row matrix:

The primary use of the bra representation is when we take the [[Inner Product|inner product]] of a [[Quantum Mechanical System|system]]â€™s [[Eigenvector|eigenvector]] with the [[Quantum States|state]] to find the probability that the corresponding [[Eigenvalue|eigenvalue]] will be measured. This uses the following notation:
