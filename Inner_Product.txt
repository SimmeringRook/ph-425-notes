====== Inner Product ======
Created Saturday 14 March 2020

The inner product is the [[Projection|projection]] of the ket onto the bra, which results in a scalar value (analogous to the dot product between two vectors). Note that the inner product of two [[Basis|basis]] vectors is 1 because we have imposed the restriction that all basis vectors must be normalized.

In the beginning, using matrix notation may make this process easier to see:

The order in which bras and kets are placed in this bracket is important. Consider the state:

Where a and b are complex numbers

	In dirac notation, this looks like:

In matrix notation, this looks like:
