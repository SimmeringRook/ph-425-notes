====== Basis ======
Created Saturday 14 March 2020

A basis in quantum mechanics is no different than a basis for any other mathematical system. We use a linear combination of kets to describe a basis for a quantum system. All of these basis kets and their corresponding bras have the restriction that they must be normalized.

Each basis has the three following properties:
* [[Normalization]]
* [[Orthogonality]]
* [[Completeness]]
