We use kets to encode information about the quantum system into the state. Kets are the [[Eigenvalue|eigenvalues]] and [[Eigenvector|eigenvectors]] of the [[Observables|observable]] the state is trying to describe. We can also display this information with [[Matrix|matrices]], in which case a ket represents a column matrix:

The row matrix version of the ket is called a [[Bra|bra]]. Since kets represent eigenvectors, you should treat them the same as vectors.
