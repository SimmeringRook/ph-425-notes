====== Quantum States ======
Created Saturday 14 March 2020

A quantum state can be represented in a variety of ways:
	* As a [[Wave function|wave function]]:
			{{..\wavefunction_representation_of_quantum_state.png}}
	* As a linear combination of [[Ket|kets]]:
			{{..\ket_representation_of_quantum_state.png}}
All quantum states are [[Normalization|normalized]], which means taking the norm squared of the [[Inner Product|inner product]] with itself will equal 1.
